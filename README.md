More than 30 developers and 5 coaches will try to build advanced and extendable eCommerce Platform using `Test Driven Development` and `API Driven Development` approaches.

The Platform will be divided to Common Modules that any group can contibute to, or can be satisfied using official or 3rd party Laravel Packages, and the Group's Modules that must be developed by the teams by there coaches advises and monitoring.

The main idea behind the project that we try to select modules that be extendable and have multiple types or implementation support, and a project that has many intergration points. This type of projects will help us incerase the attendees `OOP`, `SOLID`, and `IoC` knowladge and practical experiance.

The figure below shows both common and group's modules, and how they will be divided between the coaches. More details will be published soon.
